# Seattle Airbnb Data Science Project

This project focuses on diving into Airbnb reviews & data for the city of Seattle. The project itself is found in the 'Seattle Airbnb Project' notebook. The other 3 python files are small chunks of code that helped during the project itself. The data used can be found in Kaggle, the link is provided ( https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle ). Due to the size of the data, it is not provided in this repository, but can be easily seen by checking out the Kaggle site.
